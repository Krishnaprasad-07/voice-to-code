Voice-to-Code System

A Voice-Activated Coding Assistant that converts spoken instructions into executable code. This project aims to make coding easier, faster, and more accessible by integrating speech recognition with automated code generation.

🚀 Features

🎤 Speech-to-Text Conversion using reliable recognition engines

🧠 Command Interpretation to understand coding instructions

💻 Automatic Code Generation (Python only for now)

🪶 Lightweight UI for user interaction

🗂️ Modular Structure for easy extension



---

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

SpeechRecognition / Google Speech API

Pyttsx3 (optional for voice feedback)

Ollama (Llama 3.2 model) for interpreting voice commands and generating Python code

Other Python libraries used by your project


(Note: Currently supports Python-only code generation. Other languages planned for future updates.)

▶️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:





git clone https://github.com/yourusername/voice-to-code.git cd voice-to-code

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
---

## 📝 How It Works
1. The system listens to the user's voice.
2. Speech is converted into text.
3. The text is parsed to detect coding-related commands.
4. Relevant code is automatically generated in the selected language.
5. Output is displayed or saved as a code file.

## 📌 Example Commands
Since this project currently supports **only Python**, here are relevant example commands:
- "Create a Python function that prints Hello World"
- "Generate a for loop that prints numbers from one to ten"
- "Create a Python list with values one to five"
- "Write a Python class with an init method"

## 🌟 Future Enhancements
- Support for more programming languages
- GUI-based interface
- Browser integration
- Real-time code preview
